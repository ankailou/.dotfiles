2015-09-07 19:52:54	CaptKirby	in every other arena ho-oh looks better
2015-09-07 19:52:56	CaptKirby	but lugia has the better sprites
2015-09-07 19:52:56	@RODAN	i like ho-ohs gsc spites
2015-09-07 19:52:56	CaptKirby	& the original argument was
2015-09-07 19:52:57	CaptKirby	lugia being more popular
2015-09-07 19:52:57	CaptKirby	which it IS
2015-09-07 19:52:59	@RODAN	more than lugia
2015-09-07 19:53:17	CaptKirby	it ranked higher in ign's poll & has always cost more
2015-09-07 19:53:17	@RODAN	well duh
2015-09-07 19:53:21	@RODAN	lugia had a movie

2015-09-07 22:00:19	PK_Gaming	Yeah it was pretty godlike, no lie
2015-09-07 22:00:22	Firestorm	i'm going through the peace walker tapes before starting
2015-09-07 22:00:22	Coronis	ah
2015-09-07 22:00:28	Firestorm	there is so much in this game
2015-09-07 22:00:33	Coronis	i've never played little big planet
2015-09-07 22:00:36	thomas	rodan IIRC they're sorta spectacle fighters in the style of bayonetta or no more heroes; you do loads of flashy combo attacks on lots of enemies, look cool, feel badass, and get scores
2015-09-07 22:00:36	Firestorm	why did nobody tell me this was mainline so i could have finished it a long time ago
2015-09-07 22:00:49	@RODAN	i love
2015-09-07 22:00:52	@RODAN	no more heroes.
2015-09-07 22:00:55	Firestorm	i could have told you mgs4 was shit btw
2015-09-07 22:00:57	Firestorm	mgs4 was dumb
2015-09-07 22:00:57	@RODAN	i havent played bayonetta yet
2015-09-07 22:00:59	Firestorm	it's hella fan service
2015-09-07 22:01:04	Firestorm	but dumb
2015-09-07 22:01:08	PK_Gaming	Right? 
2015-09-07 22:01:12	&Theorymon	I think thats why I like it Firestorm 
2015-09-07 22:01:16	&Theorymon	the fan service got to me man
2015-09-07 22:01:16	Firestorm	the worst pacing of any metal gear outside of maybe peace walker if what i'm led to believe is true
2015-09-07 22:01:26	Firestorm	Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence is the best Metal Gear game
2015-09-07 22:01:27	Firestorm	fact
2015-09-07 22:01:28	PK_Gaming	And it basically takes a massive shit on MGS2 
2015-09-07 22:01:28	&Theorymon	yeah Ive heard peace walker's pacing sucks
2015-09-07 22:01:30	thomas	I guess this means MGS is like the inaccurately named hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy trilogy
2015-09-07 22:01:31	PK_Gaming	which is art

2015-09-08 01:58:32	&Theorymon	for a while it made Salamence usage crater till people started using Toxic Salamence

2015-09-08 01:59:46	&Theorymon	Yilx: breaking news, they're removing the pentagon rule
2015-09-08 01:59:52	&Theorymon	Jibaku just broke it

2015-09-08 02:00:37	&Theorymon	was it the japanese page or something
2015-09-08 02:00:41	&Theorymon	it was just a bunch of gibberish
2015-09-08 02:01:19	%JibaNOTHERE	I couldnt find the english one
2015-09-08 02:01:27	@Yilx	wat is dis
2015-09-08 02:01:28	&Theorymon	now hmmm
2015-09-08 02:01:35	&Theorymon	wtf to do against Sheer Cold Suicune
2015-09-08 02:01:43	&Theorymon	closest thing I can think of is uhh
2015-09-08 02:01:43	Rainman_Legends	sand attack :D
2015-09-08 02:01:48	&Theorymon	use sash Serperior and hope for the best
2015-09-08 02:01:50	%JibaNOTHERE	if it helps
2015-09-08 02:01:52	&Theorymon	OHKO ignores evasion modifiers
2015-09-08 02:01:55	@Yilx	accuracy mods dont affect ohko moves rainman_legends
2015-09-08 02:01:58	%JibaNOTHERE	Suicune isnt top 12 in xy metagame
2015-09-08 02:01:59	Rainman_Legends	oh well rip
2015-09-08 02:02:02	%JibaNOTHERE	the problem is
2015-09-08 02:02:05	%JibaNOTHERE	that tier is dead
2015-09-08 02:02:06	%JibaNOTHERE	so

2015-09-08 02:02:14	%JibaNOTHERE	if it's an accurate rep
2015-09-08 02:02:16	&Theorymon	I predict increase in Suicune
2015-09-08 02:02:26	@Yilx	which is why ohko moves counter minimize chansey
2015-09-08 02:02:30	@Yilx	+6 evasion?
2015-09-08 02:02:31	@Yilx	still 30%
2015-09-08 02:02:33	@Yilx	-6 evasion?
2015-09-08 02:02:34	@Yilx	sitll 30%

2015-09-08 02:37:22	SgtWoodsy	yeah i know that thing too but

2015-09-08 02:37:28	SgtWoodsy	neither is this
2015-09-08 02:37:28	@Yilx	it isnt at all lol
2015-09-08 02:37:29	&Theorymon	yilx for a moment I thought you were gonna shock me by giving me a picture of a Sony Playstation net Yaroze or whatever its called
2015-09-08 02:37:35	@Yilx	but
2015-09-08 02:37:38	@Yilx	i used it to play 
2015-09-08 02:37:41	@Yilx	at hotels

2015-09-08 02:38:06	Rainman_Legends	Who doesn't want original sotn on the go
2015-09-08 02:38:08	&Theorymon	I used to bring my N64 and PSone with me on all vacations
2015-09-08 02:38:09	SgtWoodsy	so yeah
2015-09-08 02:38:10	SgtWoodsy	tmon
2015-09-08 02:38:23	SgtWoodsy	how much do i need to pay to get a somewhat decent looking portable ps1
2015-09-08 02:38:25	SgtWoodsy	that isn't a psp
2015-09-08 02:38:28	&Theorymon	I have no clue
2015-09-08 02:38:30	&Theorymon	last time I saw them
2015-09-08 02:38:33	&Theorymon	they still looked horribly ugly
2015-09-08 02:38:36	SgtWoodsy	actually fuck it i can probably just buy a tablet
2015-09-08 02:38:45	&Theorymon	woodsy the problem is that
2015-09-08 02:38:50	&Theorymon	they have to fit the disc drive in
2015-09-08 02:38:53	SgtWoodsy	ah
2015-09-08 02:38:54	SgtWoodsy	right
2015-09-08 02:38:55	&Theorymon	like Ive seen better looking portable N64s
2015-09-08 02:38:59	&Theorymon	they're still ugly but
2015-09-08 02:39:02	&Theorymon	they tend to be smaller too
2015-09-08 02:39:21	&Theorymon	but the disc drive fucking destorys a portable PS1's form factor lol
2015-09-08 02:39:22	Rainman_Legends	Just get a smaller PS1 looking thing that can run the games off a USB drive
2015-09-08 02:39:24	Rainman_Legends	If they exist
2015-09-08 02:39:27	&Theorymon	you're better off with the PSP man
2015-09-08 02:39:32	SgtWoodsy	yeah
2015-09-08 02:39:34	SgtWoodsy	i bought the go
2015-09-08 02:39:34	&Theorymon	no such things exist RODAN 
2015-09-08 02:39:37	&Theorymon	err Rainman_Legends 
2015-09-08 02:39:37	+joshe	you could get one of those
2015-09-08 02:39:39	+joshe	winbooks
2015-09-08 02:39:46	SgtWoodsy	i have 25 games on it
2015-09-08 02:39:47	&Theorymon	if you want PS1 on the go just emulate it
2015-09-08 02:39:47	+joshe	i dunno how powerful they are for emulating
2015-09-08 02:39:52	SgtWoodsy	so i am quite content
2015-09-08 02:40:11	SgtWoodsy	i was playing tombi on it the other day remember
2015-09-08 02:40:26	Rainman_Legends	Yea getting a good laptop and having a 360 controller and emulating them is the best

2015-09-08 02:43:15	&Theorymon	its a portable japanese turbo grafix
2015-09-08 02:43:23	&Theorymon	the japanese one had way way more games
2015-09-08 02:43:35	&Theorymon	and also some really terrible games I want to play some day like TOILET KIDS
2015-09-08 02:43:43	Rainman_Legends	The only game I know for the turbo grafix was castlevania rondo of blood
2015-09-08 02:44:00	&Theorymon	have any of you ever heard about toilet kids
2015-09-08 02:44:15	Rainman_Legends	It sounds like a game I don't want to hear about

2015-09-08 02:44:39	&Theorymon	its a top down shooter where you're a kid on a toilet fighting evil animals that poop and pee on you. I cant believe this game exists
2015-09-08 02:44:41	&Theorymon	it is literally
2015-09-08 02:44:47	&Theorymon	the dumbest video game ever made

2015-09-08 02:45:55	SgtWoodsy	i didn't
2015-09-08 02:46:00	SgtWoodsy	it seems to be a fine game
2015-09-08 02:46:02	SgtWoodsy	but it's really dumb
2015-09-08 02:46:05	SgtWoodsy	all metal gears are
2015-09-08 02:46:14	&Theorymon	well yeah that comes with the territory
2015-09-08 02:46:31	&Theorymon	woodsy whenever I hear people saying MGS1 is a work of art
2015-09-08 02:46:36	&Theorymon	I instnatly think about

2015-09-08 02:48:10	&Theorymon	metal gear has always been absurd
2015-09-08 02:48:15	&Theorymon	metal gear 2 had venmous hamsters
2015-09-08 02:48:21	&Theorymon	and a puzzle where you had to hatch an owl over a guards head

2015-09-08 02:49:55	Crestfall	The gameplay is what launched the series into popularit
2015-09-08 02:50:11	Crestfall	Most other games in the same genre never truly matched up to what people wanted in terms of spying/lurking aroudn
2015-09-08 02:50:16	Rainman_Legends	I don't really care for MGS and silent hill but I at least acknowledge how good they are
2015-09-08 02:50:28	Crestfall	MGS actually made being stealthy and sneaky the core aspect of the game at parts
2015-09-08 02:50:31	&Theorymon	yeah MGS is a strange beast really
2015-09-08 02:50:34	Rainman_Legends	Horror genre isn't my thing and stealth DEFINITELY isn't my thing
2015-09-08 02:50:41	&Theorymon	like a lot of people
2015-09-08 02:50:46	Rainman_Legends	It's why I couldn't get into hitman series
2015-09-08 02:50:48	&Theorymon	remember Metal Gear games for their story
2015-09-08 02:50:52	SgtWoodsy	you have to actually stealth in mgs1
2015-09-08 02:50:53	&Theorymon	so it gives the impression to a lot of people

2015-09-08 03:21:02	Bobo	"this stinks it's not like the old games"
2015-09-08 03:21:05	Bobo	and my brother agreed
2015-09-08 03:21:10	Bobo	4 IS where the survival horror became like
2015-09-08 03:21:12	Bobo	action horror
2015-09-08 03:21:16	Bobo	but it is still a great game
2015-09-08 03:21:36	Bobo	imo
2015-09-08 03:21:40	Bobo	4 was fine
2015-09-08 03:21:43	Rainman_Legends	I'd rather deal with Ashley than shiva
2015-09-08 03:21:50	Bobo	6 was super action horror but I LOOOVED it
2015-09-08 03:21:53	Rainman_Legends	At least Ashley didn't waste your ammo
2015-09-08 03:21:57	Bobo	6 is an amazing broop game

2015-09-08 03:24:03	@RODAN	do you think there is such a thing as
2015-09-08 03:24:09	@RODAN	an objectively perfect video game
2015-09-08 03:24:17	@RODAN	the closest i can think of is super metroid
2015-09-08 03:24:20	PK_Gaming	god no 
2015-09-08 03:24:22	Melee_Mewtwo	-_-
2015-09-08 03:24:26	Melee_Mewtwo	of course not
2015-09-08 03:24:32	Melee_Mewtwo	you can't even come up with objective criteria
2015-09-08 03:24:36	PK_Gaming	there's no such thing as an objectively perfect anything
2015-09-08 03:24:40	Melee_Mewtwo	for what would consist a perfect video gmae
2015-09-08 03:24:49	Melee_Mewtwo	idk pk_gaming
2015-09-08 03:25:08	Melee_Mewtwo	within video games themselves you could perform

2015-09-08 03:25:35	Melee_Mewtwo	cause of how limited certain things are ya know?
2015-09-08 03:25:49	&Theorymon	PK_Gaming: I just read it
2015-09-08 03:25:51	PK_Gaming	I guess
2015-09-08 03:25:55	Melee_Mewtwo	like speed running
2015-09-08 03:26:04	Melee_Mewtwo	but with a more specific micro situation within it
2015-09-08 03:26:06	&Theorymon	Im shocked how much of that I caught onto when I was 9
2015-09-08 03:26:09	&Theorymon	does that make me a freak of nature
2015-09-08 03:26:12	Melee_Mewtwo	tas and all that 
2015-09-08 03:26:17	PK_Gaming	No but like
2015-09-08 03:26:39	Melee_Mewtwo	but yeah video games are super open and can go in so many diff directions that are all still "good"
2015-09-08 03:26:40	&Theorymon	Metal gear was among the few m rated series my parents would let me play
2015-09-08 03:26:41	PK_Gaming	you get why MGS2 is art™ right?
2015-09-08 03:26:54	&Theorymon	oh yeah I get it PK_Gaming, though I forgot about the dogtag part somehow
2015-09-08 03:26:54	Melee_Mewtwo	so having a single game being elevated to perfection makes no sense
2015-09-08 03:27:03	&Theorymon	I just think its still stupid, even if its amazing. its a real paradox I guess
2015-09-08 03:27:08	PK_Gaming	dude
2015-09-08 03:27:14	&Theorymon	basically PK_Gaming as a kid
2015-09-08 03:27:19	PK_Gaming	it's the culmination of the entire game!
2015-09-08 03:27:21	&Theorymon	I started noticing all the MGS references
2015-09-08 03:27:24	&Theorymon	and was thinking
2015-09-08 03:27:25	--	Melee_Mewtwo is now known as Melee_Teleportwo
2015-09-08 03:27:26	PK_Gaming	It's not stupid... it's beautiful :')
2015-09-08 03:27:40	&Theorymon	"ok is this game toying with me"
2015-09-08 03:27:47	&Theorymon	the moment they revealed S3
2015-09-08 03:27:52	&Theorymon	I was like "I FUCKING CALLED IT"
2015-09-08 03:27:56	&Theorymon	well the equivlent of a 9 year old saying that
2015-09-08 03:28:04	SgtWoodsy	If we focus too closely on recreating every element of past information, we end up in a nightmarish alternate universe where Metal Gear Solid 2 is just a plain old retread of Metal Gear Solid 1, with nothing new or interesting to say.
2015-09-08 03:28:10	SgtWoodsy	well i dunno about the last part of that sentence
2015-09-08 03:28:17	PK_Gaming	I kind of want to beat your 9 self up 
2015-09-08 03:28:22	PK_Gaming	9 year old self up*
2015-09-08 03:28:24	SgtWoodsy	but metal gear solid 2 is literally a retread of metal gear solid 1
2015-09-08 03:28:26	SgtWoodsy	that's the point
2015-09-08 03:28:27	&Theorymon	btw PK_Gaming people are having meltdowns over MGSV's ending
2015-09-08 03:28:29	&Theorymon	I cant wait to et to it
2015-09-08 03:28:42	Melee_Teleportwo	how many consoles
2015-09-08 03:28:43	Melee_Teleportwo	would i need
2015-09-08 03:28:45	Djura	meltdowns in a good or bad way
2015-09-08 03:28:47	Melee_Teleportwo	to play the series

2015-09-08 03:28:51	PK_Gaming	No it isn't... You did understand what that person was getting at, yes?
2015-09-08 03:28:53	Djura	oh
2015-09-08 03:28:55	SgtWoodsy	a ps3
2015-09-08 03:28:56	Rainman_Legends	PS1,2,3
2015-09-08 03:29:02	&Theorymon	jsut get a PS3 and a PS4
2015-09-08 03:29:05	&Theorymon	and you'll be fine Melee_Teleportwo

2015-09-08 03:29:13	&Theorymon	but fuck that port
2015-09-08 03:29:22	Rainman_Legends	MSX versions uhhhh
2015-09-08 03:29:28	&Theorymon	Rainman_Legends: theres a PS3 collection
2015-09-08 03:29:30	&Theorymon	that has the MSX games
2015-09-08 03:29:33	Djura	I should get MGS1

2015-09-08 03:29:41	Melee_Teleportwo	does ps4
2015-09-08 03:29:42	Melee_Teleportwo	not play
2015-09-08 03:29:44	Melee_Teleportwo	ps3 games?

2015-09-08 03:29:49	Melee_Teleportwo	lol
2015-09-08 03:29:54	Melee_Teleportwo	how did they 
2015-09-08 03:29:58	Melee_Teleportwo	drop the ball on soemthing like that
2015-09-08 03:29:59	Rainman_Legends	Unless you wanted PS4 to cost 800 dollars
2015-09-08 03:30:01	SgtWoodsy	also the two msx games are in mgs3
2015-09-08 03:30:07	&Theorymon	because it uses a totally different architechure
2015-09-08 03:30:10	Melee_Teleportwo	oh
2015-09-08 03:30:13	Melee_Teleportwo	whatever
2015-09-08 03:30:15	Rainman_Legends	Because they needed to put in a literal PS3 as well
2015-09-08 03:30:18	Djura	Is it unreasonable
2015-09-08 03:30:26	Djura	to say that I want all of MGS except 4 to come to PC

2015-09-08 03:30:48	Rainman_Legends	It was because they put a literal PS2 into the PS3
2015-09-08 03:30:49	&Theorymon	is because its so reliant on the PS3 architecture

2015-09-08 03:33:41	Djura	It has controller inputs most of the time instead
2015-09-08 03:33:48	Djura	so it's sort of more suited to controllers
2015-09-08 03:33:51	&Theorymon	I didnt know about that kind of stuff as a 9 year old PK_Gaming 
2015-09-08 03:33:52	Rainman_Legends	Well the difference here is that the majority agrees it's a good game

2015-09-08 06:01:19	Fubbychucker	Also: A curiosity I have that I haven't found an answer to quite yet. After breeding pokemon, what's the most efficient way to level them to 100 (I assume level 100 is where most competitive battles take place)
2015-09-08 06:01:30	Bobo	after you breed them
2015-09-08 06:01:35	Bobo	you need to very carefully ev train them
2015-09-08 06:01:41	Bobo	which can be done in one of two ways usually
2015-09-08 06:01:49	Bobo	hordes + power item + pokerus
2015-09-08 06:01:51	Bobo	or you can use super training
2015-09-08 06:01:57	Fubbychucker	The mini game, or by defeated pokemon that provide the right EV yield
2015-09-08 06:01:59	Bobo	which works just fine but is considerably slower iirc
2015-09-08 06:02:00	Bobo	yeah
2015-09-08 06:02:05	Bobo	after ev training is done
2015-09-08 06:02:10	Bobo	get the EV ribbon to be sure
2015-09-08 06:02:16	Bobo	and depending on the game
2015-09-08 06:02:21	Fubbychucker	I'm playing on Y
2015-09-08 06:02:32	Bobo	there's a restaurant 
2015-09-08 06:02:33	CDB-PHONE	super training is actually pretty fast
2015-09-08 06:02:42	Bobo	in uhh, the hub town
2015-09-08 06:02:44	Fubbychucker	Super training seems remarkably easy
2015-09-08 06:02:49	Fubbychucker	right
2015-09-08 06:02:52	Bobo	that you get after you beat the champion
2015-09-08 06:02:56	Fubbychucker	the lumious city or whatever
2015-09-08 06:02:57	Bobo	you do rotations there, iirc?
2015-09-08 06:03:00	Bobo	or triples
2015-09-08 06:03:01	Bobo	idr for sure
2015-09-08 06:03:11	Bobo	and you get very reasonable exp
2015-09-08 06:03:14	Bobo	you just need like
2015-09-08 06:03:16	Fubbychucker	basically there's a source of infinite trainers there?
2015-09-08 06:03:20	Bobo	the mewtwo you find in game to sweep
2015-09-08 06:03:25	Bobo	yes but it costs money
2015-09-08 06:03:29	Bobo	I don't remember 100%
2015-09-08 06:03:33	Bobo	how that strategy works
2015-09-08 06:04:13	Fubbychucker	Would it be wise, if i want to be competitive, to pick up Alpha or Omega?
2015-09-08 06:04:22	Djura	Doesn't matter in the end

2015-09-08 06:46:28	Fubbychucker	So I'm not sure I understand IVs. They're generated randomly whenever a pokemon in the world is generated (though through breeding there are ways to manipulate it. And they value between 0 and 31
2015-09-08 06:46:52	Fubbychucker	But does that mean is has 31 extra attack beyond it's listed 'base' stats?
2015-09-08 06:47:01	Fubbychucker	if it has 31 IV in attack
2015-09-08 06:47:26	DHR	probably not
2015-09-08 06:47:28	Bobo	it's a very slight difference iirc
2015-09-08 06:47:33	Bobo	from a 0 to 31
2015-09-08 06:47:34	DHR	Most websites
2015-09-08 06:47:37	Bobo	but it's important

2015-09-08 06:48:01	Bobo	ooh really
2015-09-08 06:48:07	Bobo	I thought it was some weird number in the teens
2015-09-08 06:48:24	Bobo	I think that the ivs are also generated in the egg
2015-09-08 06:48:32	Bobo	in addition to whether it's shiny or not
2015-09-08 06:48:50	Fubbychucker	Does shiny matter, beyond the novelty of it?
2015-09-08 06:48:57	Bobo	nada
2015-09-08 06:49:10	Bobo	if you luck out and somehow get a 6-31 perfect shiny
2015-09-08 06:49:18	Bobo	then people will likely accuse you of generating it

2015-09-08 07:41:55	Fubbychucker	my tyrantrum is strong jaw
2015-09-08 07:41:57	galbia	idk i think ttrum plays more as a rock type

2015-09-08 07:42:10	Mocirano	What does that even mean
2015-09-08 07:43:16	galbia	that it makes better use of rock type moves than dragon type moves in RU
2015-09-08 07:43:31	galbia	dragon has good coverage yes but rock has even better
2015-09-08 07:43:43	galbia	and since its usually choiced
2015-09-08 07:43:50	galbia	the move with less immunities is the better one
2015-09-08 07:44:15	galbia	aka you spam head smash with no recoil instead of the weaker/more accurate but that locks you move

2015-09-08 07:53:06	Fubbychucker	I'm not overly worried about it, i'm just not sure i want to make the money and time investment for this. This is a lot more intimidating than I thought it was going to be. The resources either seem outdated, or specifically tuned to people who are already familiar with the meta
