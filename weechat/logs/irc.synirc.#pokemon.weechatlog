2015-07-28 16:56:37	Tyrell	Quick uh... programming question, for those adept: I'm currently starting again on my IV Calculator (last editted in August), and I've opened up my notes and saw that I recorded an issue with one of the formulae.
2015-07-28 16:56:37	Tyrell	The formula, using reverse algebra, would be this: ((Stat/Nature - 5)*100) / Level - 2*Base - EV/4 . It works perfectly for Lv.100, but in some cases, when I expect 30-31 on a calculation with a hindering nature, 28-29 shows up. What could I be doing wrong here?

2015-08-01 00:24:24	Mental	right?
2015-08-01 00:24:26	Mental	I remember using that myself
2015-08-01 00:24:27	Bobo	which is likely how, because this is a 151 mon run, how they're gonna get all the red pokemon
2015-08-01 00:24:30	Rainman_Legends	but you can get any pokemon
2015-08-01 00:24:31	Bobo	since no trading
2015-08-01 00:24:33	Bobo	and mew
2015-08-01 00:24:35	Mental	But it's most notable for Mew
2015-08-01 00:24:37	Mental	above all others
2015-08-01 00:24:39	Rainman_Legends	becuase you can manipulate the special stat
2015-08-01 00:24:40	Mental	But it's cool you can get any mon
2015-08-01 00:24:43	Rainman_Legends	for any pokemon
2015-08-01 00:24:48	Rainman_Legends	you can also get glitch pokemon this way
2015-08-01 00:24:53	Rainman_Legends	which may or may not break your game
2015-08-01 00:25:23	Fusxfaranto	the glitch pokemon themselves actually rarely break the games
2015-08-01 00:25:30	Fusxfaranto	it's usually a subset of the glitch moves
2015-08-01 00:26:00	Fusxfaranto	(most of which cause problems because of the glitchy names missing the "end name" character)
2015-08-01 00:26:13	Rainman_Legends	some of them we're pretty bad iirc
2015-08-01 00:26:23	Rainman_Legends	'm had a good chance of breaking your game
2015-08-01 00:26:28	Fusxfaranto	not really
2015-08-01 00:26:42	Fusxfaranto	maybe if you put it in your box

2015-08-01 00:28:15	+breh	it's a glitch that spawns a glitch item in your inventory or something

2015-08-01 14:58:02	@RODAN	hes a girl
2015-08-01 14:58:10	BattlefyFirestorm	bloo was pretending to be a boy but was apparently a girl
2015-08-01 14:58:10	@RODAN	and was melding with his roommate
2015-08-01 14:58:13	tab	he had a sex change
2015-08-01 14:58:14	@RODAN	to form the ultimate lifeform
2015-08-01 14:58:19	BattlefyFirestorm	and instead of revealing that, made a girl account
2015-08-01 14:58:32	BattlefyFirestorm	but didn't want the girl account to be a random, so wanted to have credibility and entered the smogon tournament with it
2015-08-01 14:58:36	%v	lol
2015-08-01 14:58:45	THE_IRON_KENYAN	yeah hes a walking anime plot dude

2015-08-01 14:58:53	%v	thats the one id want to go in the history books
2015-08-01 14:58:55	BattlefyFirestorm	bloo then rigged pairings so the girl account stylez or whatever would play against only people who would team build with bloo
2015-08-01 14:59:07	BattlefyFirestorm	then bloo built teams with them and then counterteamed them
2015-08-01 14:59:09	BattlefyFirestorm	until finals
2015-08-01 14:59:12	BattlefyFirestorm	A+++ cheating

2015-08-01 18:05:58	&Theorymon	I dunno its basicaly 60$ for infinite Mario levels

2015-08-01 18:06:39	&Theorymon	and said difficulty is rated by how many people have died
2015-08-01 18:06:43	&Theorymon	and how often they have died
2015-08-01 18:06:57	&Theorymon	so you can avoid the kaizo shit basically

2015-08-01 22:55:37	MrE	free baton pass
2015-08-01 22:55:44	&Theorymon	is because thats probably not consitent so it gets sent down to the low rating doldrums
2015-08-01 22:55:45	MrE	baton pass is the counter to swagger

2015-08-01 23:32:26	%v	what
2015-08-01 23:32:32	&Theorymon	oh sorry I should explain
2015-08-01 23:32:43	&Theorymon	Im making a firebot thread where Bowser takes over my account and does some sort of contest
2015-08-01 23:32:47	&Theorymon	the idea is
2015-08-01 23:32:49	&Theorymon	whoever wins
2015-08-01 23:33:01	&Theorymon	gets to change my avatar and ct for a month
2015-08-01 23:33:13	&Theorymon	I figure the stakes would force people to be funny because they get to win that
2015-08-01 23:33:14	&Theorymon	Im trying to decide if
2015-08-01 23:33:15	SgtWoodsy	i am having a hard time deciding what ps1 crash game to play
2015-08-01 23:33:18	SgtWoodsy	i have all five handy
2015-08-01 23:33:21	Bobo	tfw space jam comes on
2015-08-01 23:33:25	&Theorymon	Bowser does an engrish image contest or a Bowser Poem contest
2015-08-01 23:33:25	Bobo	but you're ranging in runescape
2015-08-01 23:33:32	&Theorymon	or some other third thing

2015-08-01 23:33:41	&Theorymon	(also this shit would be voted on lol)
2015-08-01 23:33:52	%v	these are like

2015-08-01 23:34:17	&Theorymon	shush v I dont want people to know that
2015-08-01 23:34:46	&Theorymon	what should I make bowser do hmmmm
2015-08-01 23:35:03	&Theorymon	orginally it was gonna be the engrish contest but Im sick of doing image based threads
2015-08-01 23:35:09	&Theorymon	thats just been my shtick for way too long
2015-08-01 23:35:27	@RODAN	<SgtWoodsy> i am having a hard time deciding what ps1 crash game to play

2015-08-01 23:35:37	@RODAN	play crash 2 and make a bunch of suicide jokes
2015-08-01 23:35:43	@RODAN	like the dude on sgdq

2015-08-01 23:35:45	@RODAN	the cringiest run
2015-08-01 23:35:47	Bobo	warped is 3 also
2015-08-01 23:35:47	&Theorymon	what would bowser force people to do to deface my smogon account
2015-08-01 23:35:48	@RODAN	of all time
2015-08-01 23:35:54	SgtWoodsy	no.

2015-08-01 23:36:13	Bobo	do warped tho
2015-08-01 23:36:15	Bobo	I love warped
2015-08-01 23:36:23	&Theorymon	crash 2 is the best but warpped is still a good choice
2015-08-01 23:36:31	&Theorymon	only play crash 1 if you are up for some serious challenge
2015-08-01 23:36:33	&Theorymon	that game is hard as fuck
2015-08-01 23:36:44	&Theorymon	Rodan do you have any better ideas besides a bowser poem contest

2015-08-01 23:37:10	Bobo	no spin attack
2015-08-01 23:37:12	SgtWoodsy	i 100%ed crash 1 and 2 and 105%ed crash 3
2015-08-01 23:37:16	Bobo	only jump-on-enemy kills
2015-08-01 23:37:16	&Theorymon	damn 
2015-08-01 23:37:18	+Exeggutor	was it the crash 2 run that fucked up this sgdq
2015-08-01 23:37:20	+Exeggutor	or was it just crash
2015-08-01 23:37:22	SgtWoodsy	and whatever the equivalent was for CTR
2015-08-01 23:37:22	&Theorymon	2 and 3 are easy but

2015-08-01 23:38:40	@RODAN	im not sure if its actually better than mario party
2015-08-01 23:38:41	@RODAN	or not
2015-08-01 23:38:46	Bobo	bowser would force people to write good poems about him
2015-08-01 23:38:51	Bobo	cause he never does anything ott
2015-08-01 23:38:52	SgtWoodsy	it's fine for what it is
2015-08-01 23:38:56	@RODAN	Theorymon
2015-08-01 23:38:57	&Theorymon	yeah but theres already a smogon haikou thread
2015-08-01 23:38:59	@RODAN	500 STAR PRESENT
2015-08-01 23:39:09	SgtWoodsy	it had a story mode
2015-08-01 23:39:14	SgtWoodsy	which is more than i can say for mario party
2015-08-01 23:39:21	@RODAN	mario party had story mode yo
2015-08-01 23:39:23	@RODAN	at leas
2015-08-01 23:39:25	@RODAN	least
2015-08-01 23:39:25	SgtWoodsy	i am aware mario party has canon before you perk up tmon
2015-08-01 23:39:28	@RODAN	2 
2015-08-01 23:39:29	&Theorymon	lol Rodan when I thought of this idea last week I was thinking of like Bowser promosing admins
2015-08-01 23:39:30	@RODAN	and 3
2015-08-01 23:39:30	@RODAN	did
2015-08-01 23:39:35	Bobo	4 and 5 did too
2015-08-01 23:39:36	@RODAN	5 did to
2015-08-01 23:39:37	@RODAN	too
2015-08-01 23:39:41	@RODAN	5 is the best mp gam
2015-08-01 23:39:41	Bobo	4s was actually
2015-08-01 23:39:41	@RODAN	e
2015-08-01 23:39:42	Bobo	really cool
2015-08-01 23:39:45	@RODAN	5 is the BEST
2015-08-01 23:39:52	Bobo	iirc you'd do every board with a character in mario party 4
2015-08-01 23:40:00	Bobo	and you'd get like one of 8 decorative items
2015-08-01 23:40:02	Bobo	for that character
2015-08-01 23:40:06	Bobo	so it added replay value
2015-08-01 23:40:06	@RODAN	5 had super battle mode
2015-08-01 23:40:24	&Theorymon	Rodan the reason Im not making Bowser promise admins is because I think promising something that can happen would motivate people more
2015-08-01 23:40:31	+Exeggutor	the only relevant mario part is mario party ds
2015-08-01 23:40:34	&Theorymon	+ I wanna see wtf people stick me with
2015-08-01 23:40:39	Bobo	ds was actually alright
2015-08-01 23:40:46	Bobo	I remember trying that
2015-08-01 23:40:47	&Theorymon	only rule Im making is that it has to be semi safe for work
2015-08-01 23:40:48	Bobo	it wasn't that bad

2015-08-01 23:41:04	Bobo	best picture wins
2015-08-01 23:41:05	+the_angry_scientist	or 1000 coins

2015-09-07 16:03:53	imanalt	big thing w/ weight of ball is it affects how fast the ball goes
2015-09-07 16:03:59	imanalt	dramatically
2015-09-07 16:04:11	imanalt	if the table plays slowly its worth keeping a hand on the keeper usually, if it plays fast no point
